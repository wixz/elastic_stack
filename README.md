# Elastic Stack implementation

This project includes a fast [installation](https://github.com/wixz/elastic_stack/blob/master/installation.md)guide focusing on getting the elastic stack up and running.

Since I'm using hardware from Ubiquit (USG, AP, Switch e.t.c.) and pihole as internal DNS-Sink, logstash filters for these logs can be found in /logstash/.

This is an early version of this public repo. expect more additions in the close future.
